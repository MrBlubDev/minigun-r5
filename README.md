 Framework 2.0 Installation (PUBLIC)

 Drag and drop the script into platform/scripts/weapons
 Then, drag and drop the playlist_r5_patch into platform folder and replace. (Highly recommend backing up your platform folder first)
 Next, Add it to the dev menu by going to platform/vscripts/ai/sh_dev_npc_settings.gnut
 Finally run the game and fingers crossed it wont crash!

 You can also precache it in _mapspawn script but you dont have to.

 # Framework 1.0 - 2.0 Release script notes

 Hello. I made a script or something along those lines that allows you to use both framework 1.0 - 2.0 which i'm pretty happy about but this script also is private for now. If you have framework 1.0 soon there will be a 1.0 release but I highly recommend 2.0 if you want pleasant gameplay.
