2) Added Gold Mag
3) Works with JANUs Framework 1.0 and 2.0

Please do not repost these scripts saying there yours, because they arent. So yeah i've warned you...

INSTRUCTIONS*: If u are adding my Minigun, add everything in the Dev Playlist Vars bit of the playlist script for the weapon to work.

Easier to understand guide:

1) Put the mp_weapon_m4.03t9 script in the weapons folder.
2) Add everything in the Dev Playlist vars section of playlist file.
3) Add it to the dev menu in scripts\vscripts\ai\sh_dev_npc_settings\
4) Finally, precache it in _mapspawn.gnut in the vscripts folder
